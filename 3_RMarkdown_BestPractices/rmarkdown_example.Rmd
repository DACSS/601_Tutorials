## Introduction
We can do basic arithmetic very easily in R. Let's start with addition.

### Addition
You can use R as a calculator to do addition, using `+` the same way you would on a standard calculator.
```{r addition}
4+4
8+9
```

### Subtraction
The same goes for subtraction, but with the `-` symbol.
```{r subtraction}
10-8
9-6
```

### Multiplication
And multiplication, with `*`.
```{r multiplication}
5*3
4*2
```

### Division
Lastly, division uses the `/` symbol.
```{r division}
9/3
40/6
```

## Conclusion
Arithmetic is simple, easy, and convenient in R.
